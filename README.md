# Disfigure Mod Manager

A simple desktop manager for Disfigure BepInEx plugins. It detects the game folder, installs BepInEx when needed, and lets players install, update, enable, disable, and uninstall plugins from a public catalog without a GitHub account or token.

## Download

[Download Disfigure Mod Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Purpledudr/Disfigure-Mod-Manager/releases/download/manager-v1.0.0/DisfigureModManager-win-x64.zip)

Extract the ZIP and run `DisfigureModManager.exe`. The manager automatically looks for Disfigure in Steam libraries; use **Browse** if the game is elsewhere.

Linux and Steam Deck players running Disfigure through Proton should select a Windows x64 IL2CPP BepInEx package in the manager. A native Linux BepInEx package is not compatible with the Windows game under Proton.

The manager prevents plugin changes while Disfigure is running. If the game is open when a change is requested, close it first; the restart reminder only appears when the game is actually running.

## Available plugins

- **Disfigure Translation Mod 0.7.9:** Adds nine community language translations and supports Disfigure 1.0.
- **Sandbox Mode 0.3.74:** Opens an in-run panel for upgrades, mutation stacks, timer controls, and enemy spawning.
- **Disfigure Optimization Mod 0.3.4:** Disables expensive post-processing, shadows, motion vectors, and projectile trails for roughly 20–35% more FPS without changing gameplay or noticeably changing the visuals.

The manager reads [plugins.json](plugins.json), so new plugins and releases can be added without publishing a new manager build.

## How to use it

1. Open the manager and confirm the detected Disfigure folder.
2. Install a compatible BepInEx version if prompted.
3. Use **Available Plugins** to install plugins from the catalog.
4. Use **Installed Plugins** to update, enable, disable, or uninstall them.

## Translation Mod controls

- **F8:** Open the language menu
- **F5:** Reload translations
- **F4:** Force a text rescan

Supported languages are English, Español, Français, Русский, Deutsch, Português (Brasil), 简体中文, 日本語, and Polski. Translations are machine-assisted and may contain mistakes.

## Help translate

Current game translations and blank community worksheets are available in [community-translations](community-translations), organized by full language name. Additional blank files cover the README and instructions, Mod Manager text, and Sandbox Mode text. Anyone can fork the repository, edit a language file in GitHub, and submit a pull request for review. See [Contributing translations](CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md) for instructions.

## Sandbox mode Mod 
while in a run press **F5** to open the sandbox menu. select any upgrades, perks, or mutations you want, no limit. 
You can change the time to whatever you want, usually to be used for fighting bosses or testing a build in late game. 
Spawn any enemy you want, if you do so at a very early time, like 1 minute, a late game miniboss will be extremely slow and is great for testing damage without worrying about dying.

You will not be able to gain score while the mod is enabled, to play a run normally disable the mod in the mod manager.

### AI Use disclaimer

Yes, AI was used to make this stuff, I'm a single dad with a full time job so I don't have alot of free time. But I love the game and making these mods is how i want to contribute to the community. 
I don't condone the way alot of people are using AI as a crutch for thinking and are hurting others with it's use. I only and will only ever use AI as what its meant to be, a tool, like a calculator or a shovel, all its meant for is to be used as a helping hand.
